    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Chicken katsu is Japanese-style fried chicken. This is my family recipe
      and can also be used to make tonkatsu by using pork cutlets instead of
      chicken. Serve with white rice and tonkatsu sauce.

    <p>
      Katsu is a Japanese dish of crispy fried cutlets coated with Panko bread
      crumbs. Popular varieties are chicken katsu (like this recipe) and
      tonkatsu (which is made with pork).
